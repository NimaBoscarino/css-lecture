HTML gives structure to a web page
HTML is the frame of a webpage

HTML gives meaning to content.

semantics

- descriptive
- what does this thing MEAN
    - why should I care?
    - what is this related to?



KEEP IN MIND: YOUR BROWSER INTERPRETS YOUR HTML



Our final page that's shown on the screen:

- a product of meaning + information
- a product of style


UL?

- unordered list


P tag means: paragraph

video tag means: video

div: container? division? schism?
- when you divide?
- a particular area of the page that's been isolated? because we want to make it look prettier than the rest of the page
    - for aesthetic reasons
    - to draw the reader in
    - TO DRAW THEM TO PARTICULAR MEANING

AN ISSUE with just saying "container" is that we lose meaning

- this is for navigation
- this is for information on an aside
- this is a footer

It makes it easier to find the content that we're looking for

SEMANTIC HTML
